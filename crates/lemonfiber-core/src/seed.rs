//! Wiring the services to each other.
//!
//! Two gates before anything is written: a service that is not answering is
//! skipped rather than failed, so the whole run stays resumable; and a value the
//! operator changed themselves is preserved rather than reverted.
//!
//! That second gate is what makes seeding safe to run against a stack somebody
//! has tuned by hand, and it is the resolution of the standing tension between
//! reproducible and customised.
//!
//! Every write is read back to confirm it landed, and recorded so it can be
//! undone.
//!
//! Arrives with seeding. See `.docs/architecture/module-layout.md`.
